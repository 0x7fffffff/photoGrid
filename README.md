Barebones grid based image gallery

===================
 
This is an example of using block enumeration to create a grid like photo gallery.

NOTE: This should only serve as a demonstration of how to create a grid of objects in a loop. This code should not actually be used in a production photo gallery application. If you want to have a grid to display many photos, you may want to instead look into the UICollectionView class, which is available in iOS 6 +.

Project includes examples using assets from the camera roll as well as local images stored in the project.

Local images tab supported tap to zoom functionality.
